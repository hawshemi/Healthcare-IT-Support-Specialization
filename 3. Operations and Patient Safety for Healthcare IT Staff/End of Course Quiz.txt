QUESTIONS
----------------------------

Take a look at the following image and then read the scenario below.


As a help desk agent at a large hospital, you receive a call from a nurse who is frantic. She needs to give a patient a blood transfusion. The patient has arrived with a wristband and the nurse is very concerned about the wristband. “There are 4 barcodes on the wristband!!! I think a mistake has been made! What do I do? Do I need to get the patient a new wristband? I have to scan the wristband for proper identification before proceeding with the blood transfusion. Help!” 

Which of the following would be a correct response to the nurse? 

1 point

“You’re correct to be concerned. I’ve never seen this type of issue before. Very strange. Let me escalate the matter to the Tier 2 support staff so they can help you.”


“I can see that you're concerned, but this nothing to worry about. Those are 4 copies of the same barcode image. They are intentionally placed on the patient’s wristband, so that based on the position of the patient, any one of them can be scanned easily.”


“Hmmm, it looks like a mistake in the printing. Has the printer been functioning properly for other admitted patients? When is the last time another patient had this issue?”


“What are you talking about? Did you not receive training on proper barcode scanning and use of patient wristbands? How long have you been in this role?”


“I think you should take the wristband off the patient immediately. Let me see what I can do to get the patient a new wristband that only has 1 barcode on it.”

Question 28
It’s your 2nd week as an IT support specialist at a health system in New York City. You’re contacted by an office manager for an outpatient clinic because the primary care physicians in her practice are not able to print out prescriptions for their patients. After asking for her full name, userID and a good call back number, you proceed with troubleshooting the issue. She says that the HP Photosmart C420 printer was working fine yesterday. She confirms that the printer is plugged in. She also explains that there’s paper in the printer and no error message. You ask her to go to her settings and to pull up the Printer application. This is what she sees. Which of the following would be an appropriate response? 



1 point

“Unfortunately, I don’t think there’s anything we can do at this time. Since it’s likely a matter of ordering a new printer for the clinic. We have several options in the technology store. Would you like me to share the website with you?”


“Do not worry, we should be able to resolve this quickly for you. It appears that the printer you’d like to be printing to is offline. So the prescriptions have been printing to a printer elsewhere. I’ll walk you through selecting the correct printer, but also recommend that you go to the other printer to find the prescriptions so that protected health information isn’t shared with individuals who don’t need to have access to it.”


“Sounds like a paper jam. What you need to do is resolve that, and then you should see the prescriptions printing out properly. I’m happy to walk you through the steps involved in fixing this matter. It can generally result from a misfeed and if the paper appears crumpled, we’ll need to carefully remove all of it. Then we’ll be able to test things again to see if the prescriptions are printing properly.”


“Ah, I see what’s going on. It looks like you are low on toner. Whenever that happens, it’s important to replace the print cartridge. I’m happy to go through the steps involved with that if you’d like.”


“This is pretty surprising that your clinic isn’t making use of e-prescribing. I don’t understand why you would still be printing out prescriptions and handing them to patients.”


“This is odd. It looks like the correct printer has been selected, so I don’t think that’s the issue. Let’s see it’s a driver compatibility issue.”
